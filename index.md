## What is NEASU?

NEASU is an organization of Asian students at boarding schools across New England, started in 2019 by the Andover Chinese Student Association at Phillips Academy.

NEASU was first launched to help organize an interscholastic Lunar New Year celebration on February 2nd, 2020.

In response to the cancellation of on-campus classes at Andover, Exeter, and other schools due to the Coronavirus pandemic, spurred by an [Andover CAMD](https://www.andover.edu/learning/brace-center-camd) club leaders meeting, NEASU aims to be a platform to support and develop our campus communities virtually, providing opportunities for connection, discussion, education, and advocacy.

Currently, there are two planned ways for NEASU to fulfill its mission. **One is the NEASU Slack server,** found at [neasu.slack.com](https://neasu.slack.com/). We hope for this server to provide open chatroom for students to connect and freely discuss anything that they want to, supplying back parts of lost club meetings and events. The second initiative is to **host a series of webinars on Zoom.** This initiative responds as well to the cancellation of events like the [Asian American Footsteps Conference](https://www.aafc2020.org/), planned to have been hosted at Exeter, and Andover's TEDx Conference. Many students have proposed and prepared valuable workshops and talks for these events, and many more students looked forward to participating in them, things that are now impossible in person; with NEASU as a centralized, virtual platform, we hope to provide opportunities for this work to be shared.

If you would be interested in hosting a webinar or helping out with NEASU in any way, **please don't hesitate to contact us!**
